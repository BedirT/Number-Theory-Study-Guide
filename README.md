# Number Theory Study Guide
---
Since I had hard time understanding Number theory topics from both my lectures and my book, I decided to make a study guide and add every source that I use to understand the topics. I was just going to make a blog post, but decided that repository would be more beneficial since everyone can contribute and it will be more dynamic this way...

### Topic 1: Preliminaries
It is preliminaries... I didn't really study here because I already knew the topics from my previous classes, but I will try to put some useful sources here.

Basically topics here are just proof systems and how to do proof properly in Math.

- Will put something about Basic Induction :)
- Will put something about Strong Induction :)
- Binomial Theorem

The book that I am working on, just passed over these topics so you don't really have to work deeply on them. Knowing how to use induction would be beneficial though (more like neccesity :) ). I don't think we will cover other proof methods like deductions etc. in this course, so Induction will be assumed as default proof solving concept.

### Topic 2: Divisibility Theory in the Integers
##### The Division Algorithm
This really is too basic... Literaly... 

I will just put the definition for "the Division Algorithm" and you will see what I mean:
**Theorem** Given integers a, b with b > 0 there exist some unique integers q and r such that,
a = qb + r where 0 <= r < b... Really...

##### The Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)
I used the book for the concept I believe. It is an easy topic, but it might be tricky if you are not using calculator and the numbers are enormous.

##### Euclidean Algorithm to find GCD
This is an algorithm to solve GCD problems. Basically, (at least in the book that I am studying) this is the way we approach to almost any gcd problems in hand.

##### Diophantine Equations
Fancy name,

##### The Least Common Multiple (LCM)


### Topic 3: Primes and Prime Distibutions

##### Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic

##### Sieve of Erotosthenes

##### The Goldbach Conjecture

### Topic 4: The Theory on Congruences

[Congurences and Fermat's Little Theorem - DLBmaths](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgPfagOgOAc)
[Chinese Remainder Theorem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ru7mWZJlRQg)

### Topic 5: Fermat's Theorem

##### Fermat's Decomposition
- Video: Beautiful video that explains what Fermat's decomposition is, with example questions. I love the guy who creates these videos (I already put couple videos of him for the previous chapters.) ENJOY! [Video Link - DLBmaths](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0a6R8qPZCk4)

This topic is not that hard, so just this video should be enough for understanding the topic. A little practice and you will be set for your exam...

### Topic 6: Number Theoretic Functions

##### Tau Function

##### Sigma Function

##### Euler's Phi Function

##### Mobius Function


##### Hensel's Lemma
This is not covered in this topic, but we learned it in this chapter, so I will include it here.

### Topic 7: Euler's Generalization of Fermat's Theorem
